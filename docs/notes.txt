MongoDB Atlas
-- is the developer data platform
-- its is a database as a service.

Replica Data - group of servers that hold data together
--- it ensure data redundancy and high availability.

cluster -- several MongoDB working together

shared cluster
-- small

dedicated cluster
-- larger and dedicated resources

Atlas
-- Operational insights
-- backup with point in time restore
-- online archive

organizations - group and define users and teams
              - grants access to projects.

projects - allow you to define and organize resources

- CLUSTER -- mangodb cloudbase developer base platform.

notes:::
   MongoDB Atlas is a developer data platform that stores your data in Atlas clusters, a global, multi-cloud database service. You also learned that the developer data platform has many features that enable you to build a wide variety of applications.

You created a free Atlas account and deployed a free tier Atlas cluster by doing the following:

Chose a shared cluster.

Chose a major cloud provider to host your cluster.

Used the region recommended by MongoDB as the location of database deployment.

Prepared to connect to your cluster by adding a database user and password and an IP address to the IP Access list


mongoDB and document model
mongoDB - general purpose document database.


common uses of mongodb
  - ecommerce
  - content management
  - iot and time series
  - trading and payment
  - gaming
  - real time analytic and AI
  - mobile applications


document - basic unit of data in mongodb
collection - a grouping of document
database - container for a collection

mongodb database is at the core of the atlas( the developer data platform)

document model
-- displayed in json format
-- stored in bson format.
BSON- add additional data types that are unavailable in json

ObjectID - used in mongodb to create unique ids

Every document require an _id field that act as primary key
- if not provided the mongoDB will automatically provide an ObjectID for the _id field

By default mongoDB supports flexible schema model.
-- Allows to show documents in different structures in the same collection
-- flexible schema enable us to iterate quickly and evolve as our requirements change
-- mongoDB supports polymorphic data.

Atlas Data Explorer
-- atlas built in tool that interact and manage data from the atlas UI


MongoDB Data Modelling
-- refers to how data is being stored and relationship that exist among different refrences

   --- WHEN DEVELOPING YOUR DATABASE THIS ARE THE QUESTION YOU SHOULD ASK ---
     - what does my applications
     -  what data will I store
     -  How will users access the data
     -  What data will be the most valuable to me

     Good data model
     - help manage data
     - make good use of cpu
     - make queries more effincient
     - reduce costs

     Relationships type of Data.

      -- one-to-one
      -- one-to-many
      -- many-to-many

      Ways to model relationships
      -embedding
      -refrencing

      one-to-one
      - Relationship where one data set in one entity is connected exactly to another one data  in another set

      one-to-many
      - Relationship where one data entity in one set is connected to any number of  data entities in another set.

      many-to-many
      - relationship where any number of data entities in one set are connected to any nunber of data entities in another set

      embedding
      - we take related data and insert into our document
      - used when referencing one-to-many or many-to-many

      referencing
      - we refer our document in another collection in our document

      adv of embedding
      - avoid join applications
      - provide read perfomance for read operations
      - allows developers to update related data in a single written operation

      Reference/ linking/ data normalization
      - save the _id of one document in another document as a link between the two.

      optimium effinciency in:

      - memory usage
      - query result time
      - cpu usage
      - storage

      unbounded document - document that grow infinitely

      common schema anti patterns

      - massive arrays
      - massive numbers of collection
      - bloated document
      - unnecessary indexes
      - query without indexes
      - data that can be accessed together but stored in different collection

      atlas tools
       - data Explorer
       - perfomance advisor

       mongoDB connection string
       -- allows us to connect to our cluster and to work with our data.
       -- describe the host we will be using the option we will be using to connect to the mongoDB

       - it can be used to connect from the mongoDB shell, compass, and applications

       format for the connection
       - standard format
       - DNS seed list format

       - standard format -
       - used to connect to standalone clusters, replica sets or sharded format.

       - DNS seed list format -
       - provides DNS server list to our connection string


-- connection strings and all that it entails  --

mongodb+srv://myAtlasDBUser:<password>@myatlasclusteredu.kmyoknr.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

-- mongodb - as it appears it used to represent the mongoDB connection string
-- mongoDB atlas uses DNS seed list behind it

-- +srv - it sets the tls security option to true and tells the mongoDB to use the DNS seed list.

-- myAtlasDBUser:<password> - this are the username and password key in when creating the mongoDB

-- @myatlasclusteredu.kmyoknr.mongodb.net - reprent the host the optional port number. (27017)

-- retryWrites=true&w=majority - represent any option you want to includes e.g connection timeout, tls and ssl,

-- retrywrites = true = this one tells the mongoDB to retry when certain drivers


-- CONNECTING TO A MONGODB ATLAS CLUSTER WITH MONGODB SHELL --
-- mongoDB shell its node js wrapper enviroment.
-- which will give it access to
   --- javascript
   -- variable
   -- functions
   -- loops
   -- conditional statements


   -- CONNECTING MONGODB ATLAS CLUSTER WITH COMPASS --
   mongoDB compass - its graphical user interface used to query our data, analyze our data and compose our agreggation pipelines

   mongoDB drivers --
   -- allows application to connect to the database using connection string
